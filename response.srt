00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,595
Dad, you're going to have to come home early today.

2
00:00:04,595 --> 00:00:12,145
My mom's not answering her phone. But this asshole crashed this thing. This one had diarrhea. This one.

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:13,103
I have diarrhea.

4
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:14,270
On the ground

5
00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:18,275
In a cage on the carpet

6
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:25,820
Leave now, now, now. I can't leave now. Dad doesn't get home until 6:00.

7
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,306
Do it as soon as possible.

8
00:00:27,306 --> 00:00:29,050
Okay. I'm not answering my mom's phone as soon as I can.

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,560
My mom isn't answering her phone.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,595
Leave it alone. Don't clean it up, it stinks.

11
00:00:33,595 --> 00:00:40,315
No, I don't smell it yet, but I'm gonna have to wipe it down a little bit. Some of the chunks are coming out, and it's a big puddle. Now.

12
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:42,465
So you two are sick.

13
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:51,230
I think I ate something wrong with this thing. I'm looking at it now and it's now 50,000 poop bags. This motherfucker.

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,160
He's got it all on his quilt.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,350
I just got home.

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,283
ì–´

17
00:00:58,283 --> 00:00:59,480
I'll be right there.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,270
Hurry up. I get off work at 5:30.

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,688
Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can.

20
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:07,247
I can't watch that right now. I don't want to eat anything right now. I'm hungry.

21
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:08,675
So, are you going to Grandma's?

22
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,327
No I don't want to bother

23
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:11,453
Okay. Okay.

24
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:16,520
That would be a bed.

25
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,645
Okay, okay.

26
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:21,920
Come on.
